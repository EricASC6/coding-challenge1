	Title: Sentence Smash
	Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
	Example:
		const words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'];
		smash(words); // returns "hello world this is great"
		Assumptions
		You can assume that you are only given words.
		You cannot assume the size of the array.
		You can assume that you will always get an array.
	What We're Testing:
		We're testing basic loops and string manipulation. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and string manipulation.

/*
Write two functions:
toArray(), which converts a number to an array of its digits.
toNumber(), which converts an array of digits back to its number.
Examples:
toArray(235) ➞ [2, 3, 5]
toArray(0) ➞ [0]
toNumber([2, 3, 5]) ➞ 235
toNumber([0]) ➞ 0
Notes
All numbers in the tests will be weakly positive (>= 0)

//===============================================
// First Vowel
/*
Create a function that returns the index of the first vowel in a string.
Examples
firstVowel("apple") ➞ 0
firstVowel("") ➞ -1
firstVowel("hello") ➞ 1
firstVowel("wqtrgfbsdfghJKvc") ➞ -1 // No vowel
firstVowel("STRAWBERRY") ➞ 3
firstVowel("pInEaPPLe") ➞ 1
Notes
Inputs will be single words and can be an empty string.
Characters in words will be upper or lower case.
"y" is not considered a vowel.
